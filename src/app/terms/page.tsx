          If you are a Consumer, you have the right to cancel your purchase of
          our Services within 14 days from the day following the completion of
          your transaction, without the need to provide any reason. To exercise
          this right of cancellation, you must notify Cver Job Applications LTD
          of your decision within the 14-day period. Upon receipt of your
          cancellation request—and provided that the Services have not been
          substantially used or accessed beyond any trial period—you will be
          entitled to a full refund of all payments made in connection with the
          transaction. The refund will be processed using the same payment
          method employed for the original transaction, and no cancellation fees
          will be incurred. For subscription-based Services, this right to
          cancel applies solely to the initial purchase and does not extend to
          any subsequent automatic renewals. Please note that once the Services
          have been fully delivered, downloaded, or otherwise accessed in a
          manner that precludes a meaningful cancellation, your right to a
          refund may be limited or excluded in accordance with applicable law.
          By completing a transaction with Cver Job Applications LTD, you
          acknowledge and agree to the terms of this Refund Policy.

            Changes to these Terms or our Services.

          <br />
          <br />
          We are continuously working to develop and improve our Services. We
          may update these Terms or our Services accordingly from time to time.
          For example, we may make changes to these Terms or the Services due
          to:
          <br />
          1. Changes to the law or regulatory requirements.
          <br />
          2. Security or safety reasons.
          <br />
          3. Circumstances beyond our reasonable control.
          <br />
          4. Changes we make in the usual course of developing our Services.
          <br />
          5. To adapt to new technologies.
          <br />
          6. We will give you at least 30 days advance notice of changes to
          these Terms that materially adversely impact you either via email or
          an in-product notification. All other changes will be effective as
          soon as we post them to our website. If you do not agree to the
          changes, you must stop using our Services.

            Delay in enforcing these Terms.

          <br />
          Our failure to enforce a provision is not a waiver of our right to do
          so later. Except as provided in the dispute resolution section above,
          if any portion of these Terms is determined to be invalid or
          unenforceable, that portion will be enforced to the maximum extent
          permissible and it will not affect the enforceability of any other
          terms.
